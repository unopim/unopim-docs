# Install Using Amazon Cloud AMI

Follow these steps to install UnoPim on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using an Amazon Machine Image (AMI):

## Installation Steps

**Step 1: Launch the EC2 Instance**

- [Launch an EC2 instance from the Unopim AMI via AWS Marketplace.](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-fdyosdv7k3cgw)
- Wait until the instance status is “running”.

**Step 2: Access Your EC2 Instance**

- Set your PEM file permission:
    ```sh
    chmod 400 your-key-file.pem
    ```
- Connect to your instance:
    ```sh
    ssh -i your-key-file.pem ubuntu@your-instance-ip
    ```
    Replace `your-key-file.pem` and `your-instance-ip` with your actual key and public IP.

**Step 3: Run SSL Script**

- Make sure your domain’s A record points to your EC2 Elastic IP.
- (If using Cloudflare or a similar proxy, disable proxy before running the script.)
- Run the SSL configuration:
    ```sh
    sudo bash /root/ssl_configuration.sh
    ```
    This sets up Let's Encrypt SSL and configures Apache for HTTPS.

**Step 4: Complete Unopim Installation Through the Web Interface**

- Visit `https://yourdomain.com/` in your browser.
- Click **“Continue”** on the setup screen.
- Follow the on-screen steps:
    - **System Requirements:** Review and continue.
    - **Database Setup:** Use credentials found on your server:
        ```sh
        cat /var/www/html/unopim/mysql_password.txt
        ```
    - **Start Installation:** Click the button to install Unopim.
    - **Domain URL:** Enter your domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`).
    - **Set Defaults:** Timezone, locale, currency, and allowed options.
    - **Admin Setup:** Create admin credentials and set timezone/locale.

- After setup, log in to the Unopim Admin Panel.

**Security Step:**
Delete the credentials file after setup:
```sh
sudo rm /var/www/html/unopim/mysql_password.txt
```
